					<p>Josef Novak, one of the co-founders of the internationally successful Swiss provider of
						AI-powered
						customer success solutions, has played a vital role in implementing state-of-the-art
						technologies
						since its inception. His work has played a crucial role in establishing Spitch's current leading
						position in this dynamic industry.</p>
					<p>With immediate effect, Spitch appoints Josef Novak as the Chief Innovation Officer. In this role,
						he
						will be responsible for Spitch's strategically central innovation division. He will help
						steering
						the development of new AI capabilities, collaborating with stakeholders and researching market
						trends to drive innovation. Josef Novak is based in Zurich and reports to Spitch CEO Alexey
						Popov.
					</p>
					<p>Spitch's nine-year success story is also a story of innovation, which has been integral to the
						rapid
						growth of the Zurich-based company. Josef studied linguistics at UC Santa Barbara, followed by
						an
						M.E. in computer science at the Tokyo Institute of Technology and a Ph.D. at the University of
						Tokyo. His dissertation work focused on applied aspects of Automatic Speech Recognition and
						Grapheme-to-Phoneme conversion. He was also involved in speech technology startups and
						participated
						in research internships at the Japanese National Institute of Information and Communications
						Technology (NICT).</p>
					<p>As one of the co-founders of Spitch, Josef has been instrumental in keeping Spitch at the
						forefront
						of the latest technology trends, helping to bring them to market and ensuring that partners and
						customers alike can benefit. He led the way in early VoIP efforts, championing the adoption of
						the
						MRCP, SIP and GRXML standards. Josef also initiated and oversaw the initial implementations of
						the
						Dialog Composer and Speech Analytics products, and introduced end-to-end speech-to-text
						technologies
						at Spitch.</p>
					<p>Describing his new role, Josef Novak states: "Spitch's continued success depends heavily on our
						ability to innovate and bring the latest technologies to market without delay – especially
						today. As
						CIO, I will continue to drive new and untried ideas, just as I have done since we started the
						company. My goal is to continue strengthening our integrated innovation activities, thereby
						enhancing our company’s profile as well as our revenue and growth potential in the years ahead."
